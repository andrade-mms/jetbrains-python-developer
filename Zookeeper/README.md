# Zookeeper

**About**
This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after
its dezinens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals
and their status.

**Learning outcomes**
This project is aimed at begginers. It helps to understand
some syntax basics and learn how to work with variables, data
storage types such as lists, and while loops.
